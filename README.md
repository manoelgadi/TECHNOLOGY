## IE - TECHNOLOGY course FINTECH: Building a Flask App with Machine Learning on PythonAnywhere

This repository accompanies a two-part video series demonstrating the development and deployment of a Flask application with machine learning integration on PythonAnywhere.

**Learning Objectives:**

* Set up a basic Flask app structure with Bootstrap styling.
* Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for data and model creation.
* Train and persist a machine learning model.
* Deploy Bootstrap and Machine Learning Model using Flask app on PythonAnywhere.

**Videos:**

* **Part 1: Flask App Structure and Bootstrap Integration**
  - [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo)
  - This video guides you through downloading a Bootstrap template, separating styles, and establishing a basic Flask app structure with routing and templates.

* **Part 2: Creating Data, Model, and Deployment**
  - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng15EVDrL28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng15EVDrL28)
  - This video focuses on generating or collecting data, building a machine learning model (potentially with LLMs), persisting the data and model for deployment, and deploying the Flask app on PythonAnywhere.

**Code Structure:**

This repository may contain the following files or folders, depending on the specific video content:

* * `flask_app.py`: The main Flask application file generated after completing video 2.
* * `01_ai_prompt_for_ml_model.txt`: The prompt used at the start of video 2 to generate the synthetic data and the machine learning model.
* * `flask_app.py`: This is the main Python file for the Flask application, handling the routing, logic, and serving of web pages generated after completing video 2.
* * `index.html`: This is the HTML file that defines the structure and content of the main page of the web application adapted from Grayscale Bootstrap template during the video 2.
* * `startbootstrap-grayscale-gh-pages.zip`: This is a backup for the Grayscale Bootstrap template, the original can be downloaded from: [https://startbootstrap.com/previews/grayscale]



**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow along with the video tutorials and adapt the code to your desired application.
